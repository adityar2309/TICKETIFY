## Discovered During Work

### SMTP Service Issue
**Date**: 2025-06-02
**Description**: Celery tasks are failing due to SMTP connection refused on localhost:1025. Need to either:
1. Set up a local SMTP server (like Mailhog or fake SMTP)
2. Configure proper email service (SendGrid, Gmail, etc.)
3. Add fallback/mock for development environment

### PowerShell Environment
**Date**: 2025-06-02
**Description**: Windows PowerShell requires different syntax than bash - using `;` instead of `&&` for command chaining.

### WSL Redis Setup
**Date**: 2025-06-02
**Description**: Successfully configured Redis on WSL Ubuntu. Redis is now running on 127.0.0.1:6379 and accessible from Windows.
